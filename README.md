# PARASECT

Welcome to PARASECT: Predictive Algorithm for Resolving A-domain Specificity featurising Enzyme and Compound in Tandem. Detect NRPS AMP-binding domains from an amino acid sequence and predict their substrate specificity profile.

You can find our preprint on [bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.01.08.631717v1).

## Information on branches

The current `master` branch contains all code that is needed to reproduce our findings in the manuscript.

The `webapp` branch contains minimal code from the `master` branch that is needed to run the web application.

You can find a live version of the web application [here](https://paras.bioinformatics.nl/).

## Trained models

The trained models for PARAS and PARASECT can be found on Zenodo [here](https://zenodo.org/records/13165500).
