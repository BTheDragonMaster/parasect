# PARASECT

Welcome to PARASECT: Predictive Algorithm for Resolving A-domain Specificity featurising Enzyme and Compound in Tandem. Detect NRPS AMP-binding domains from an amino acid sequence and predict their substrate specificity profile.

## Information on branches

The current `master` branch contains all code that is needed to reproduce our findings in the manuscript.

The `webapp` branch contains minimal code from the `master` branch that is needed to run the web application.

You can find a live version of the web application [here](https://paras.bioinformatics.nl/).

## Trained models

The trained models for PARAS and PARASECT can be found on Zenodo [here](https://zenodo.org/records/13165500).


## To do
- [ ] Add explaination on data files to README.md
- [ ] Refactor frontend, and implement results page instead of results modal
- [ ] Add training scripts for all three models
